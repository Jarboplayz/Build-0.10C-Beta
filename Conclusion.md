The video shown is where the first test of the physics and dialog. The dialog is beeing worked on. It has A TON of bugs. Like the hitboxes are completely broken.
But I am still trying to find a way to fix it. But the bug still remains, is where you stop, it still moves. Like as shown in the video. That is what I can't fix.
But it will may be fixed soon. Cause the character is ice skating for some reason. So yeah! See you on release
